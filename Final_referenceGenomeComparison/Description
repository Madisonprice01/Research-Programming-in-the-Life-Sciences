refComparer.py takes input files containing the CRISPR guide counts in an older reference genome, a newer reference genome, and in the novel regions of the newer reference.
It finds the CRISPR guide sequences that are used in both the old and new references and flags the guides that have different counts, i.e. the ones that occur in the novel regions of the new reference genome. 
Reference genomes GRCh38 (HG38 in the UCSC genome browser) and T2T-CHM13 (CHM13 in the UCSC genome browser) were used to test the program.
